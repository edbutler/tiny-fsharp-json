tiny-fsharp-json
================

Really small json parser/formatter for F#.

For use with my personal projects (such as Unity games) that need simple Json processing in an F#-y way without big dependencies. It doesn't support the full spec, just what I need. I'm throwing it up here to make it easy to share between projects. Using it will require some slight modifications (e.g., adding a namespace to the top of the files) but, otherwise, it can easily be dropped into any F# project.
